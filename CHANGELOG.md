## [unreleased changes]

please add changes here

## [0.7.1] - 2022-05-25

### Added

- Added an optional fourth parameter to `call_function`, `timeout`, which accepts a value in milliseconds that will cap the execution time of the function. The default behavior if not supplied is preserved, which is a 5 second timeout. Thanks @brooksmtownsend for this contribution


## [0.7.0] - 2022-03-27

### Added

- Added support for precompiled binaries. This should reduce compilation time of wasmex significantly. At the same time it frees most of our users from needing to install Rust. Thanks @fahchen for implementing this feature

### Changed

- Wasmex now aims to support the last three elixir and OTP releases. The oldest supported versions for this release are elixir 1.11.4 and OTP 22.3 - Thanks to @fahchen for contributing the CI workflow to test older elixir/OTP versions
- Moved CI systems from CircleCI to GitHub Actions. Let me thank CircleCI forthe years of free of charge CI runs, thanks! Let me also thank @fahchen for contributing this change
- Thanks to @phaleth for fixing page sizes in our Memory documentation
- Updated several project dependencies, most notably wasmer to 2.1.1

## [0.6.0] - 2021-08-07

### Added

- `Wasmex.Module.compile/1` which compiles a .wasm file into a module. This module can be given to the new methods `Wasmex.Instance.new/2` and `Wasmex.Instance.new_wasi/3` allowing to re-use precompiled modules. This has a big potential speed-up if one wishes to run a WASI instance multiple times. For example, the wasmex test suite went from 14.5s to 0.6s runtime with this release.
- `Wasmex.start_link` can now be called with a precompiled module.
- `Wasmex.Module.compile/1` can now parse WebAssembly text format (WAT) too.
- WASM modules without exported memory can now be instantiated without error.
- Added the following functions to `Wasmex.Module`:
  - `serialize/1` and `unsafe_deserialize/1` which allows serializing a module into a binary and back
  - `name/1` and `set_name/1` which allows getting/setting a modules name for better debugging
  - `imports/1` and `exports/1` which lists a modules imports and exports

### Deprecated

- `Instance.from_bytes/2` and `Instance.wasi_from_bytes/3` are deprecated in favor of `Wasmex.Instance.new/2` and `Wasmex.Instance.new_wasi/3`. Both may be removed in any release after this one.

## [0.5.0] - 2021-07-22

### Added

- Added WASI support. See [Wasmex.start_link/1](https://hexdocs.pm/wasmex/Wasmex.html#start_link/1) for usage instructions and examples.

```elixir
# after a `wapm install cowsay`
{:ok, bytes } = File.read("wapm_packages/_/cowsay@0.2.0/target/wasm32-wasi/release/cowsay.wasm")
{:ok, stdout} = Wasmex.Pipe.create()
{:ok, stdin} = Wasmex.Pipe.create()
{:ok, instance } = Wasmex.start_link(%{bytes: bytes, wasi: %{stdout: stdout, stdin: stdin}})
Wasmex.Pipe.write(stdin, "Why do you never see elephants hiding in trees? Because they're really good at it.")
{:ok, _} = Wasmex.call_function(instance, :_start, [])
IO.puts Wasmex.Pipe.read(stdout)

```

## [0.4.0] - 2021-06-24

### Added

- added support for OTP 24.0 (by updating rustler)

### Changed

- Wasmex.Memory.bytes_per_element changed its signature from
  `Wasmex.Memory.bytes_per_element(memory, :uint32, 0)` to `Wasmex.Memory.bytes_per_element(:uint32)`.
  The existing signature `Wasmex.Memory.bytes_per_element(memory)` still works as before.
- changed the default development branch from `master` to `main`
- targeting and testing on elixir 1.12 and OTP 24.0 now - older versions are likely still working, but will not be tested anymore.

### Removed

- `Wasmex.Memory.grow/4` was removed. Instead `Wasmex.Memory.grow/2` can be used interchangeably.

## [0.3.1] - 2021-04-04

### Added

- added support for `aarch64-darwin` (apple silicon). Thanks @epellis

### Changed

- removed use of `unsafe` from wasm<->elixir value conversion. Thanks @Virviil

## [0.3.0] - 2021-01-09

## Notable Changes

This release features support for elixir function that can be exported to WASM.

It also supports [the latest wasmer v 1.0](https://medium.com/wasmer/wasmer-1-0-3f86ca18c043) ðŸŽ‰.
Wasmer 1.0 is a partial rewrite of the WASM engine we use that promises to be up to 9 times faster module compilation.

### Added

- added the instances first memory into the callback context

```elixir
imports = %{
  env: %{
    read_and_set_memory:
      {:fn, [], [:i32],
        fn context ->
          memory = Map.get(context, :memory)
          42 = Wasmex.Memory.get(memory, :uint8, 0, 0) # assert that the first byte in the memory was set to 42
          Wasmex.Memory.set(memory, :uint8, 0, 0, 23)
          0
        end},
  }
}

instance = start_supervised!({Wasmex, %{bytes: @import_test_bytes, imports: imports}})
Wasmex.Memory.set(memory, :uint8, 0, 0, 42)

# asserts that the byte at memory[0] was set to 42 and then sets it to 23
{:ok, _} = Wasmex.call_function(instance, :a_wasm_fn_that_calls_read_and_set_memory, [])

assert 23 == Wasmex.Memory.get(memory, :uint8, 0, 0)
```

- added support for function imports

```elixir
imports = %{
  env: %{
    sum3: {:fn, [:i32, :i32, :i32], [:i32], fn (_context, a, b, c) -> a + b + c end},
  }
}
instance = start_supervised!({Wasmex, %{bytes: @import_test_bytes, imports: imports}})

{:ok, [6]} = Wasmex.call_function(instance, "use_the_imported_sum_fn", [1, 2, 3])
```

Thanks to

- @bamorim for helping me plan and architect,
- @myobie for help in implementation, especially for implementing the function signature checks,
- @rylev for a second eye on our Rust code,
- the @wasmerio team for the recent addition of `DynFunc` which made this feature possible, and
- @bitcrowd for sponsoring me to work on this feature

### Changed

- Changed writing and reading strings from/to memory to be based on string length and not expect null-byte terminated strings.
  This allows for a more flexible memory handling when writing arbitrary data or strings containing null bytes to/from memory.
  Thanks @myobie for implementing this feature
- Support writing non-string binaries to memory. Before we could only write valid UTF-8 strings to WASM memory.
  Thanks again, @myobie, for implementing this feature
- Updated the wasmer version, now supporting wasmer 1.0.
- Updated to elixir 1.11 and Erlang OTP 23.2. Older versions might work, but are not officially tested

### Fixed

- `could not convert callback result param to expected return signature` error for a void callback.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-04-14

This release brings is closer to a production-ready experience.
Calls of WebAssembly functions are now handled asynchronously: Invoking a WASM function via `Instance.call_exported_function` calls our Rust NIF as before, but does not directly execute the function. Instead, a new OS thread is spawned for the actual execution. This allows us to spend only few time in the NIF code (as required by the Erlang VM). Once the WASM function in that thread returns, we send a message to the calling erlang process.
To ease handling, we converted our main module `Wasmex` into a `GenServer` so that a WASM function call can be used in a synchronous manner as before.

### Added

- The `Wasmex` module is now a GenServer. WASM function calls are now asynchronous.

### Changed

- Removed unused Rust dependencies
- Provide better error messages for `Wasmex.Instance.from_bytes` when the WASM instance could not be instantiated.
- WASM function calls now return a list of return values instead of just one value (this is to prepare for WASM tu officially support multiple return values)
- Updated elixir and rust dependencies including wasmer to version 0.16.2

### Removed

- `Instance.call_exported_function/2` use `Instance.call_exported_function/3` instead.

### Fixed

- Enhanced documentation

## [0.1.0] - 2020-01-15

### Changed

- First release
