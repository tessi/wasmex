## [0.3.0] - 2020-??-??

This release features support for "imported functions".

### Added

- added support for function imports

```elixir
imports = %{
  env: %{
    sum3: {:fn, [:i32, :i32, :i32], [:i32], fn (_context, a, b, c) -> a + b + c end},
  }
}
instance = start_supervised!({Wasmex, %{bytes: @import_test_bytes, imports: imports}})

{:ok, [6]} = Wasmex.call_function(instance, "use_the_imported_sum_fn", [1, 2, 3])
```

Thanks to

- @bamorim for helping me plan and architect,
- @myobie for help in implementation, especially for implementing the function signature checks,
- @rylev for a second eye on our Rust code,
- the @wasmerio team for the recent addition of `DynFunc` which made this feature possible, and
- @bitcrowd for sponsoring me to work on this feature

## [0.2.0] - 2020-04-14

This release brings is closer to a production-ready experience.
Calls of WebAssembly functions are now handled asynchronously: Invoking a WASM function via `Instance.call_exported_function` calls our Rust NIF as before, but does not directly execute the function. Instead, a new OS thread is spawned for the actual execution. This allows us to spend only few time in the NIF code (as required by the Erlang VM). Once the WASM function in that thread returns, we send a message to the calling erlang process.
To ease handling, we converted our main module `Wasmex` into a `GenServer` so that a WASM function call can be used in a synchronous manner as before.

### Added

- The `Wasmex` module is now a GenServer. WASM function calls are now asynchronous.

### Changed

- Removed unused Rust dependencies
- Provide better error messages for `Wasmex.Instance.from_bytes` when the WASM instance could not be instantiated.
- WASM function calls now return a list of return values instead of just one value (this is to prepare for WASM tu officially support multiple return values)
- Updated elixir and rust dependencies including wasmer to version 0.16.2

### Removed

- `Instance.call_exported_function/2` use `Instance.call_exported_function/3` instead.

### Fixed

- Enhanced documentation

## [0.1.0] - 2020-01-15

### Changed
